# ONOS-Controller
This is a project of an application to control routing in MININET/ONOS topologies

# Status
Project is still in the phase of production and it is not working. Expect first working version on August/September.

# Future updates
I am planning to add:
* More than one routing algorithm to compare behaviours
* GUI for easier usage. (which hosts to connect, info about topology elements, ...)
